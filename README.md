Short Description / Purpose

This project analyzes sales performance across multiple dimensions such as ship mode, category, sub-category, segment, state, and region. The dashboard helps identify top-performing segments, shipping preferences, and geographical contributions, providing actionable insights for business strategy and decision-making.

Tech Stack üíª

The dashboard was created using Microsoft Excel, Power BI, or Tableau with the support of PivotTables and PivotCharts to summarize and analyze key metrics. Slicers and filters were applied to enable drill-downs by category, region, and time. The visualizations include bar charts, line charts, and pie charts to clearly represent trends and comparisons.

Key Insights üîç

Standard Class emerged as the most commonly used ship mode, generating the highest sales. Within product sub-categories, Chairs and Tables contributed the most revenue, while Fasteners and Labels contributed the least. In terms of customer segments, Consumers accounted for about half of the total sales, followed by Corporate with 31 percent and Home Office with 19 percent. At the state level, California led sales by a significant margin compared to other states. When viewed by category, Furniture and Technology generated more sales compared to Office Supplies.

Data Source üìÇ

The analysis is based on the Sample Superstore Sales dataset. The dataset contains attributes such as Order Date, Region, Category, Sub-Category, Segment, Ship Mode, State, and Sales Figures.

Features / Highlights ‚ú®

The dashboard includes dynamic filters for category, region, and time period. It presents a multi-dimensional breakdown of sales by ship mode, sub-category, segment, and state. The design provides an interactive experience, allowing users to explore sales distribution and performance metrics in detail.

Goal of the Analysis üéØ

The main objective is to provide actionable sales insights that support decision-making in shipping strategies, product category focus, and regional sales improvements.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals üñº

The Ship Mode Wise bar chart shows how sales are distributed across shipping modes, while the Sub-Category Wise chart ranks sales by different product sub-categories. The Segment Wise donut chart highlights the proportion of sales across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments. The State Wise line chart displays the variation in sales across states, and filters for category, region, and date allow for more targeted analysis based on specific business needs.

Business Impact & Insights üí°

The analysis reveals that focusing on the Consumer segment can drive significant growth, as it contributes the largest share of sales. Logistics can be optimized by enhancing delivery efficiency in Standard Class shipments. A higher revenue concentration in furniture, particularly chairs and tables, suggests opportunities for product diversification. California‚Äôs dominance in sales also indicates that successful strategies from this region could be replicated in other states to boost performance.
